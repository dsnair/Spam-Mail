# Project Description

This project works with e-mails that were previously classified as spam by spam detection software called SpamAssassin. We want to reassess the decisions made by SpamAssassin to filter out all of these e-mails as being spam e-mails. The training file is called Junkmail.

# Work Summary

Used R for
• Data munging. The data were e-mails in HTML format, which also contained UTF-8 characters. Converted this raw data into data frame by rigorously using regular expressions.
• Exploratory analysis to recommend spam classification criterion.
